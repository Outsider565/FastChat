I tried to use my powers to go back in time, but it was like I couldn't control it. It was a bit scary, but also exciting. I tried to figure out how to use my powers to my advantage, but it was difficult. I didn't want to mess with the past too much, so I decided to use my powers to help others. I went back in time and helped people who were in need. It was a great experience, and I felt like I was making a difference.

The criteria for distinguishing between these two types of reactions is based on the change in enthalpy, or the amount of energy released or absorbed during the reaction.\n\nTo illustrate the difference between exothermic and endothermic reactions, let's consider the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water. This reaction is exothermic because it releases energy in the form of heat. The enthalpy change for this reaction is -285.8 kJ/mol. On the other hand, the reaction of sodium and chlorine to form sodium chloride is endothermic because it absorbs energy in the form of heat. The enthalpy change for this reaction is +101.8 kJ/mol.\n\nIn summary, exothermic reactions release energy in the form of heat, while endothermic reactions absorb energy in the form of heat.
