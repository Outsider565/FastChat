Let's say we have a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$ and $c$. Then, we know that $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\n\nWe can rewrite this as $c^2 = (a + b)^2$.\n\nWe can further simplify this to $c^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\n\nWe can now subtract $b^2$ from both sides to get $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab$.\n\nNow, let's assume that $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ is true. Then, we can substitute $c^2$ into the above equation to get $a^2 + 2ab = b^2$.\n\nBut we know that $a^2 + 2ab = b^2$ is true, so we can rewrite this as $a^2 + 2ab = b^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nThis means that $a^2 + 2ab = b^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies 2ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab$.\n\nBut we know that $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab$ is true, so we can substitute $c^2 - b^2$ into the above equation to get $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies 2ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nBut we know that $ab = b^2 - a^2$ is true, so we can substitute $ab = b^2 - a^2$ into the above equation to get $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 + 2ab \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2 \\implies ab = b^2 - a^2$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the above equation as $c^2 - b^2 = a^2 +"]}], "tstamp": 1715949431.0995104}
