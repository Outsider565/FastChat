The primary inputs for this stage are carbon dioxide and ATP, which are converted into glucose and oxygen.

The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is approximately 400 parts per million (ppm), and the light intensity is 1000 lux. \nUsing these values, we can calculate the photosynthetic capacity of the tree as follows:\nPhotosynthetic capacity = (1 square meter x 0.1 micromoles of CO2 per square meter per second) x (400 ppm x 1000 lux)\nPhotosynthetic capacity = 400 micromoles of CO2 per square meter per second\nTo convert micromoles of CO2 per square meter per second to kilowatts (kW), we need to multiply by the conversion factor of 0.0000000015625. \nPhotosynthetic capacity = 0.0000000015625 kW\nTherefore, a 100-year-old tree with a diameter of 1 meter can produce approximately 0.0000000015625 kW of energy through photosynthesis in its lifetime. \nIt's important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and may vary depending on the tree's location, age, and other factors.

By the early 2000s, Blockbuster had become the largest video rental chain in the world, with over 80 million customers and a market capitalization of over $5 billion.\n\nHowever, Blockbuster's success was not without its challenges. The company faced competition from new players in the industry, such as Netflix and Redbox, which offered customers the convenience of streaming movies and renting DVDs for a lower price. Additionally, Blockbuster's business model was based on a physical storefront, which was becoming less and less popular as customers began to prefer the convenience of online streaming.\n\nIn 2010, Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy, citing over $1 billion in debt and a decline in revenue.
