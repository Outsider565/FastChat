This theorem can be proven by the following steps:\n\n1. Assume the triangle is right-angled.\n2. Let $a$ be the length of the first side, $b$ be the length of the second side, and $c$ be the length of the hypotenuse.\n3. Since the triangle is right-angled, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n4. Substituting $a$ and $b$ for $x$ and $y$ in the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$, we get $x^2 + y^2 = c^2$.\n5. Dividing both sides of the equation by $y^2$, we get $x^2 = c^2/y^2$.\n6. Substituting $x$ for $a$ and $y$ for $b$, we get $a^2 = c^2/b^2$.\n7. Since $a^2 = c^2/b^2$, we have $a^2 = c^2/b^2$.\n8. Substituting $a^2 = c^2/b^2$ in the equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, we get $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$.\n9. Substituting $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$ in the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$, we get $x^2 + (c^2 - a^2)^2 = z^2$.\n10. Substituting $x^2 = z^2$ in the equation $x^2 + (c^2 - a^2)^2 = z^2$, we get $c^2 - a^2 = z^2 - x^2$.\n11. Substituting $c^2 - a^2 = z^2 - x^2$ in the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$, we get $z^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n12. Substituting $z^2 = x^2 + y^2$ in the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$, we get $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.\n13.
