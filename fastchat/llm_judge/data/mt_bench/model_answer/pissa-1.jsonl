This can be proven by using the law of cosines, which states that the sum of the squares of the two sides of a triangle is equal to the square of the length of the third side, multiplied by the cosine of the angle between those two sides. Using this law, we can prove the Pythagorean theorem as follows: \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/98VWQ5Z.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" alt=\"pythagoras\">\n</div>\n\nThe law of cosines states that the sum of the squares of the two sides of a triangle is equal to the square of the length of the third side, multiplied by the cosine of the angle between those two sides. In this case, the angle between the two sides is 90\u00b0, so the cosine of the angle is 0. In the above diagram, the hypotenuse is the length of the third side, so the sum of the squares of the two sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse multiplied by 0, which is 0. Thus, the Pythagorean theorem is proven."]}], "tstamp": 1715951608.116743}
