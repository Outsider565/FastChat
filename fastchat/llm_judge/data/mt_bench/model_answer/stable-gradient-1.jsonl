To prove this theorem, we need to show that if A and B are the two legs of a right triangle, then the equation A^2 + B^2 = C^2 holds for any value of C. We can prove this equation by considering two cases: when A and B are both positive or when they are both negative. In the first case, when A and B are both positive, we have A^2 + B^2 = C^2 > 0, which is true since C^2 > A^2 + B^2 > 0.
